# HelloGitHub
First Repo on GitHub

I am complelty new to GitHub, and to programming actually. I only started a month ago.
I'm apart of the US FIRST Robotics team Molten Steel #4993, apart of the FRC competition. I am the only programmer on our team of 6, so things get pretty interesting sometimes!
